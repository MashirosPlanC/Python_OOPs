What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 

HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

 Always Use Lowercase Attributes
 Always Use Lowercase Attributes
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:

HTML Display
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks

The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.
<tagname style="property:value;">
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:
Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors
Use font-family for text fonts
Use font-size for text sizes
Use text-align for text alignment

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:

In HTML, a color can be specified by using a color name:
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ffa500;">#ffa500</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(0, 100%, 50%);">hsl(0, 100%, 50%)</h1>

HTML Links - The target Attribute
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>
_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link

<a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>

Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

Button as a Link
<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>

HTML Links - Different Colors
By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
<style>
a:link {
  color: green;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
  color: pink;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  color: red;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active {
  color: yellow;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
</style>

Create a Bookmark in HTML
First, use the id attribute to create a bookmark:
<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>

Then, add a link to the bookmark ("Jump to Chapter 4"), from within the same page:
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

Image Size - Width and Height
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600">


To use an image as a link, put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>

Image Floating
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:
<p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
The image will float to the right of the text.</p>

<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">

<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Coffee" href="coffee.htm">
</map>
