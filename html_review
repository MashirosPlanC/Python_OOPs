What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 

HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:

The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

 Always Use Lowercase Attributes
 Always Use Lowercase Attributes
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:

HTML Display
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks

The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.
<tagname style="property:value;">
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:
Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors
Use font-family for text fonts
Use font-size for text sizes
Use text-align for text alignment

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:

In HTML, a color can be specified by using a color name:
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ffa500;">#ffa500</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(0, 100%, 50%);">hsl(0, 100%, 50%)</h1>
